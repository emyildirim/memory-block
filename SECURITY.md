# Security Guidelines for Memory Blocks

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

### Frontend Security
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- ✅ XSS protection headers
- ✅ Frame options to prevent clickjacking
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement in production
- ✅ Secure token storage practices
- ✅ Input validation on forms
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Environment variable protection

### Backend Security
- ✅ Helmet.js for security headers
- ✅ Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- ✅ MongoDB injection protection
- ✅ JWT token-based authentication
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Input sanitization
- ✅ Request size limits
- ✅ Compression for performance

### Database Security
- ✅ Connection encryption (TLS)
- ✅ Authentication required
- ✅ Network access restrictions
- ✅ Query sanitization
- ✅ Connection pooling with limits

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Always use strong, unique secrets
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 64)

# Use production-grade database connections
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/db?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Set NODE_ENV appropriately
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Authentication Security
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- Tokens are stored in localStorage (consider httpOnly cookies for enhanced security)
- Password hashing uses bcrypt with salt rounds
- Failed login attempts are logged

### API Security
- Rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Auth endpoints: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Request size limit: 10MB
- CORS restricted to specific origins

### Data Protection
- All user inputs are sanitized
- MongoDB queries are protected against injection
- Sensitive data is not logged in production
- User passwords are never stored in plain text

## 🚨 Security Checklist for Deployment

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Change all default passwords and secrets
- [ ] Review and update CORS origins
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works
- [ ] Check error handling doesn't leak sensitive info

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Set up log monitoring
- [ ] Configure automated backups
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Review access controls
- [ ] Monitor for unusual activity patterns

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

### Recommended Tools
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Database security monitoring
- **Vercel Analytics**: Traffic and performance insights
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Dependency vulnerability alerts

### Log Monitoring
- Monitor failed authentication attempts
- Track unusual API usage patterns
- Log database connection issues
- Monitor rate limit violations

## 🛠️ Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Identify and isolate the affected systems
   - Preserve evidence and logs
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and system state
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Identify root cause

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement fixes and patches
   - Restore from clean backups if needed
   - Update security measures

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security procedures
   - Conduct security review
